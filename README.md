# Mini Game Backend
This is a backend Repository used to fetch the data from the exchange. I have used Random Values for fetching the values But We can definetely fetch data from the live market for that we can use yahoo finance sdk and the script for the same is in file `yahoofinance.js` on the root folder of this repository.

## Description:
 
Mini Game is a NFT based game which consists of 2 teams A and B. Each team contains 5 members (NFT) which holds the stock market profit/loss rate in the NFT data. Based on the sum of profit/loss rate of each NFT , at last sum of all NFT's rate of each team winner is decided. All the rates (Profit/Loss) is gathers from external API's via Oracle smart contract.
